# Introduction-to-CS-programming
A course I did that teaches the fundamentals of C# programming

## Exercise 3_1
Write a C# program which prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

## Exercise 3_2
Your task is to write a program, which prompts the user to provide name of a fruit and then prints “Your favourite fruit is name of the fruit”.

## Exercise 3_3
Write a C# program which prints out the first provided command line argument. You can assume the argument is always provided and consists of letters and digits.

## Exercise 4_1
Your task is to declare variables and assign suitable values to them according to the list below:

- var1 of type short
- var2 of type byte
- var3 of type float
- var4 of type char
- var5 of type boolean
- var6 of type ulong
- var7 of type decimal.

## Exercise 4_2
Your task is to declare the variables listed below and assign any acceptable values to them.

- var1 = 8-bit signed integer
- var2 = 64-bit signed integer
- var3 = 16-bit unsigned integer
- var4 = 64-bit double-precision floating point type

## Exercise 4_3
Declare and assign values to the variables a, b and c so that the program outputs “Success!”.

## Exercise 4_4
Declare and assign values to the variables x, y, z and b so that the program outputs “Success!”.

## Exercise 5_1
Write a C# program which asks the user’s age and then prints out if the user is eligible to cast his/her own vote. The age limit for casting a vote is 18.

## Exercise 5_2
Write a program which asks the user to input two integers and then tells which of the numbers is greater or if they are equal.

## Exercise 5_3
Write a program which prompts the user for a point in x-y coordinate system and determines in which quardant the coordinate point is located or notifies the user if the point lies on origin.

## Exercise 5_4
Your task is to write a C# program which prints a menu and asks the user for input. You must use the switch statement. The menu and output should look the following:

```
Please select:
1) Water
2) Juice
3) Lemonade
4) Quit
2
You selected Juice.
```

## Exercise 6_1
Write a C# program which accepts one command line argument of type integer. The program then prints out as many lines as the integer with a pattern shown in the example answer.

```
1
12
123
1234
12345
123456
1234567
12345678
123456789
12345678910
1234567891011
123456789101112
```

## Exercise 6_2
Write a C# program which asks the user for integers until a sum of 200 is reached.  You must use while statement to complete the task.

## Exercise 6_3
Use the foreach statement to print out the character literals in the array “characters”. The output should be: Learn C#.

## Exercise 8_2
Your task is to write a C# program which asks the user for a file name and content. Then the program creates the file with the user provided content.
