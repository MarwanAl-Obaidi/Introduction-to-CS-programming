# Introduction-to-CS-programming
A course I did that teaches the fundamentals of C# programming

## Exercise 3_1
Write a C# program which prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

## Exercise 3_2
Your task is to write a program, which prompts the user to provide name of a fruit and then prints “Your favourite fruit is name of the fruit”.

## Exercise 3_3
Write a C# program which prints out the first provided command line argument. You can assume the argument is always provided and consists of letters and digits.

## Exercise 4_1
Your task is to declare variables and assign suitable values to them according to the list below:

- var1 of type short
- var2 of type byte
- var3 of type float
- var4 of type char
- var5 of type boolean
- var6 of type ulong
- var7 of type decimal.

## Exercise 4_2
Your task is to declare the variables listed below and assign any acceptable values to them.

- var1 = 8-bit signed integer
- var2 = 64-bit signed integer
- var3 = 16-bit unsigned integer
- var4 = 64-bit double-precision floating point type

## Exercise 4_3
Declare and assign values to the variables a, b and c so that the program outputs “Success!”.

## Exercise 4_4
Declare and assign values to the variables x, y, z and b so that the program outputs “Success!”.

## Exercise 5_1
Write a C# program which asks the user’s age and then prints out if the user is eligible to cast his/her own vote. The age limit for casting a vote is 18.

## Exercise 5_2
Write a program which asks the user to input two integers and then tells which of the numbers is greater or if they are equal.

## Exercise 5_3
Write a program which prompts the user for a point in x-y coordinate system and determines in which quardant the coordinate point is located or notifies the user if the point lies on origin.

## Exercise 5_4
Your task is to write a C# program which prints a menu and asks the user for input. You must use the switch statement. The menu and output should look the following:

```
Please select:
1) Water
2) Juice
3) Lemonade
4) Quit
2
You selected Juice.
```

## Exercise 6_1
Write a C# program which accepts one command line argument of type integer. The program then prints out as many lines as the integer with a pattern shown in the example answer.

```
1
12
123
1234
12345
123456
1234567
12345678
123456789
12345678910
1234567891011
123456789101112
```

## Exercise 6_2
Write a C# program which asks the user for integers until a sum of 200 is reached.  You must use while statement to complete the task.

## Exercise 6_3
Use the foreach statement to print out the character literals in the array “characters”. The output should be: Learn C#.

## Exercise 7_2
You are provided with a List of type string having the following names:
Torvalds, Musk, Gates, Buffet, Dorsey.
Modify the list so that the items are:
Jobs, Musk, McAfee, Buffet, Wozniak.

## Exercise 8_1
Write a C# program which takes a file name as a command line argument and then prints the content of the file to the screen. Your program should check if a command line argument was provided and print “No filename provided!” if it does not exist. The program must also check that the provided file exists before reading it.

## Exercise 8_2
Your task is to write a C# program which asks the user for a file name and content. Then the program creates the file with the user provided content.

## Exercise 8_3
Create a program which opens an existing file, prompts the user for content and appends the provided content to the file.

## Exercise 8_4
Create a program which reads the files in the current directory and prints them out one file name per line.

## Exercise 9_1
In this exercise your task is to define Movie class, its fields and the constructor. The class must be serializable. The class properties are Name, Length and Year and the constructor parameters are in the same order.
